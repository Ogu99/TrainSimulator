# TrainSimulator
A small train simulator for the command prompt in Java

Note
-
The old code uses a utility class called <b>Terminal</b>. Since that class is private and copyrighted by my
university it is <b>NOT</b> included in the repository. Instead I'm using a heavily modified version of it
called <i>Sys</i> which will be added soon.

About
-

This small program provides a partly-like simple train simulation for the command prompt
written in <b>Java</b>. I'm using this repository to better organize things.
This code is crappy and I want to rework it so this is the best opportuntity to do it. So you will
first see the old version by me created back then and it will be partly updated.

Train simulator in the context means that:
<ul>
  <li> The user is able to create <b>tracks</b> represented in a 2D dimension. So every track or switch
    the user places has two/three points which can be connected to a <i>railway</i> </li>
  <li> The user can compose <b>trains</b> with different types of wagons. These can be placed on the <i>railway</i>
    to drive on<</li>
  <li> Also since we are talking about a "simulation" those trains can crash into each other or drive out
    of the railway. </li>
</ul>

How to use this program?

Coming soon.

and my university for providing a utility-class which was heavily modified
by me.
